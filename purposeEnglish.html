      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Nowadays, the food waste problem is becoming more serious in the world.</p>
      <p>I think it is most important for each person to think about food waste.</p>
      <p>So I made this site.</p>
      <p>You can see for yourself that food waste is so wasteful.</p>
      <p>I would be very happy if this problem could be solved even a little.</p>
